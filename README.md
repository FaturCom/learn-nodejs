learn_nodejs

This repository is for my Node.js learning journey.
Here I store my mini projects while I study backend development.

Each folder has a small project or experiment.

Example folders:

- user-api → CRUD User API with Express + MongoDB
- tasks-api → Task API with foreign key userId
- auth-api → Login, Register, JWT, Hashing
- tests → small tests or experiments with Node.js
- This repo will grow every day while I continue learning.

This repo is part of my Nonstop Ngoding November (NNN) challenge
